<h3>Hey! Sinamika</h3>
<p>For at least the first half of Hey Sinamika, Yaazhan (Dulquer Salmaan), its protagonist, comes across as the answer to the loosu ponnu characters that populate our screens. He is a house husband to Mouna (Aditi Rao Hydari), who works in the construction industry. He dotes on her 24x7. He is the kind of guy who walks in when she's showering to force-feed her cake! Obviously, she feels suffocated by his 'love'. She even gets a transfer to Pondicherry so that she can have some me-time, but he lands up there as well as he doesn't want her to miss him</p>
<p>Enter Dr Malarvizhi (a miscast Kajal Aggarwal), a relationship counsellor, who thinks all men are cheats, and has facilitated the separation of many couples. Mouna approaches her as a final resort. The idea is to get Malarvizhi to make Yaazhan fall in love with her, so that she can use that as an excuse to divorce him. </p>
<h3>Sita Ramam</h3>
<p>When Hanu Raghavapudi debuted in 2012 with the beautiful Andala Rakshasi, the audience had high hopes from him that were somewhat trashed thanks to films that followed. But with Sita Ramam, the director redeems himself with a poetic love story which might not be as unpredictable as the makers think but is one that keeps you hooked none-the-less.</p>
<p>In 1985, Afreen (Rashmika Mandanna) is a Pakistani rabble-rouser studying in London who is set in her ways and harbours an intense dislike for anything and everything Indian. She might be from the other side of the border but her feelings mirror that of youngsters on this side of the border even today. Early on in the film she’s told that the solution for her misplaced anger is love, a notion she brushes off as the sayings of an old man. But when she begrudgingly decides to deliver a lost letter to India, she’s transported back to 1964 where the poetic love story of Lt. Ram (Dulquer Salmaan) and Sita (Mrunal Thakur) unfolds. He is an orphan; she is a woman with a secret she can’t reveal. Even as Afreen and her begrudging partner-in-crime Balaji (Tharun Bhascker) learn everything there is to known about Sita and Ram, she might end up learning a lesson or two along the way.</p>
<h3>Por Thozil</h3>
<p>A senior cop and his trainee investigate a series of murder cases, and realise all of them are interlinked and that a psychopath is on the run. Can they get hold of him before it's too late?</p>
<p>Por Thozhil, like most investigative thrillers, opens with a mysterious murder case that puts the police officials on their toes. But how the investigation unfolds is quite unusual and interesting, as it doesn't play the usual whodunit game. Director Vignesh Raja, instead, takes us into the lives of the people with disturbed childhoods and shows how a little affection can make some sort of difference in the lives of many.</p>
